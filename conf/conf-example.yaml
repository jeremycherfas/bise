# The "reports" section contains one entry for every row in our desired output
# table. Each entry in this section contains the following keys:
#   label: The label for this report row.
#   test_type: One of "path", "path_regex", "referer_regex", or "agent_regex".
#              Describes the test to perform on a given server-log entry in
#              order to determine whether we should count it as a hit, as far
#              as this particular report is concerned.
#   test: The text of the comparison we'll make with the given server-log entry.
#         For test_type "path", this should be a literal string.
#         For every other test_type, this should be a regular expression.
